# Example Coq proof on a toy process algebra

This repository hosts a proof written in the Gallina language.
We use the Coq automated theorem prover to prove the 
equivalence of two semantics defined over a toy process algebra.

A web page (generated with coqdoc) presenting the proof can be accessed [here](https://erwanm974.github.io/coq_toy_process_algebra/).
